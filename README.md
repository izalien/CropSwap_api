# CropSwap

This is the api portion, WORK IN PROGRESS, revamp of my old capstone project. Users can add new and existing fields to current and past seasons and view crop history. Additionally, they can remove fields from a growing season.

This api is the Express.js back end for a React Native program. This program intends to assist farmers with crop management. 

Technologies used:
- Express.js
- MongoDB
