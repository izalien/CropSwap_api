# CropSwap

This is the api portion WORK IN PROGRESS revamp of my old capstone project. In the program's current state users' can add new and existing fields to their current growing season. Additonally, they can remove fields from a growing season.

This api is the Express.js back end for a React Native program. This program's 
intent is to assist farmers with crop management. 

Technologies used:
- Express.js
- MongoDB
